  "description": "It seeks to integrate barrier to a new experience of public space trough a strategy of shape and color along the Street. The proposal is inspired by de movement of cyclists, abstracting the movement of the wheels in the city through a set of chromatic rings. \n\nThe design strategy is to build a single diameter pattern in which it varies in distance and color producing a uniform movement of public space, easy to apply with volunteers and feasible for the uneven Surface. The chromatic proposal belongs to a set of vibrant colors, striking and stimulanting to perception, building a blue background in which the contrast of the chromatic rings can be notified.",
